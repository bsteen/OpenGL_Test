# OpenGL_Test
A test program I am using to learn OpenGL.
The ultimate goal of this project is to display two pictures side by side.

It uses OpenGL, SFML, and GLEW.

I am using this tutorial to make the program:
https://open.gl/

Most code in this program comes from this tutorial.
Many of the comments are also directly from the tutorial.
